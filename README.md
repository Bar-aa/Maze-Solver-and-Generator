# Maze-Solver-and-Generator
In this project, you will design and implement a system to solve and generate mazes using 
three fundamental search algorithms: A*, Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and Best-First Search 
(BFS). This project involves creating a maze generator and implementing solvers to navigate 
through these mazes efficiently.
